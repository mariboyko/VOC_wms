In enterprises like X, Google, or Microsoft, Git commit practices are more structured and standardized than in smaller teams, driven by the need for collaboration, automation, and maintainability across large codebases. Here's a concise guideline tailored to how commits are typically structured in such environments, building on the previous advice but focusing on enterprise specifics:

### Enterprise Git Commit Guideline

1. **Follow Conventional Commits**:
   - Use a standardized format like Conventional Commits (`<type>(<scope>): <description>`).
   - **Types**: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `chore` (maintenance), `docs` (documentation), `refactor`, `test`, etc.
   - **Scope**: Specify the module or component (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`).
   - Example: `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
   - **Why**: Enables automation (e.g., changelog generation, semantic versioning) and clarity in large teams. Google’s Blockly project and Microsoft’s internal workflows often enforce this.[](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/git-guidance/)[](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/commits)

2. **Summary Line**:
   - Keep it under 50 characters, imperative mood, lowercase, no period.
   - Example: `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
   - **Why**: Ensures readability in tools like `git log --stockings are used in enterprise settings to make commit messages searchable and consistent.[](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)

3. **Detailed Body (if needed)**:
   - After a blank line, explain *what* changed, *why*, and any impact.
   - Wrap lines at 72 characters.
   - Include ticket/issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes: #1234`).
   - Example:
     ```
     fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue

     Corrected CSS flexbox properties to ensure proper alignment on mobile.
     Tested on Chrome and Safari. Fixes: #567
     ```
   - **Why**: Large teams need context for code reviews and debugging. Microsoft emphasizes small, descriptive commits for traceability.[](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/git-guidance/)

4. **Reference Tickets and PRs**:
   - Link to issue trackers (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) in the body, not the summary.
   - Example: `Resolves: JIRA-1234`
   - **Why**: Integrates with enterprise tools for tracking and auditing.[](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)

5. **Small, Atomic Commits**:
   - Each commit should address one logical change (e.g., one bug fix or feature).
   - Example: Separate `refactor(auth): simplify login logic` from `feat(auth): add 2FA support`.
   - **Why**: Simplifies code reviews and reverts. Google and Microsoft advocate for atomic commits to reduce merge conflicts.[](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/git-guidance/)[](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/version-control-best-practices/)

6. **How to Commit**:
   - Stage files: `git add <file>` or `git add .` for related changes.
   - Commit: `git commit` (opens editor for detailed message) or `git commit -m "feat(api): add rate limiting"`.
   - Amend if needed: `git commit --amend` (before pushing).
   - **Why**: Enterprises like X and Google use CI/CD pipelines that rely on clean commits for automated testing and deployment.

7. **Enterprise-Specific Notes**:
   - **Google**: Uses tools like Gerrit for code reviews, enforcing strict commit message standards. Commits often align with release notes automation.[](https://www.infoq.com/articles/git-enterprise/)[](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/commits)
   - **Microsoft**: Emphasizes squash merges to reduce commit noise in main branches, with linters to enforce message formats.[](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/git-guidance/)
   - **X**: Likely similar, with a focus on integrating commits with internal issue trackers and CI systems, though specific public details are limited.

8. **Avoid**:
   - Vague messages (e.g., `fixed stuff`).
   - Unrelated changes in one commit.
   - WIP commits in shared branches (use personal branches instead).
   - **Why**: Enterprises prioritize auditability and collaboration. Sloppy commits like “broke it all” are unacceptable in Google’s or Microsoft’s workflows.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1fosyje/whats_industry_practice_for_git_repos/)

### Example Enterprise Commit
```
feat(search): add autocomplete to user query

Implemented autocomplete using Elasticsearch for faster query suggestions.
Added unit tests for edge cases. Resolves: JIRA-789
```

### How to Practice
- Next change you make, use: `git commit` and write in your editor:
  ```
  fix(config): update logging level for debugging

  Changed default log level from INFO to DEBUG to capture more details.
  Tested locally with sample requests. Fixes: #101
  ```
- Push to a feature branch, not main, to align with enterprise branching strategies.

This mirrors practices at Google (via tools like Gerrit) and Microsoft (via Azure DevOps), ensuring commits are clear, traceable, and automation-friendly.
